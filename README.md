# Sample Social Network Datasets For Teaching With Gephi (and Other Tools Like It)

This repository contains sample social network datasets specifically collected and formatted for teaching with Gephi. Each folder contains a nodes csv, an edges csv, and a GraphML file that can be imported into Gephi, as well as background information about the original source of the data, the methodologies used to compile it, and the context/significance of the social network.

Most of the edges csv files can also be dragged and dropped into [John Ladd's incredibly handy Network Navigator tool](http://dh-web.hss.cmu.edu/network_navigator/).

The sample network datasets include: [characters in the Game of Thrones universe](/sample-datasets/game-of-thrones/); [modernist authors who published together in journals](/sample-datasets/modernist_journals_project/); [characters in the Marvel Universe](/sample-datasets/marvel/); [seventeenth-century Quakers](/sample-datasets/quakers/); [books about U.S. politics that were co-purchased around the 2004 presidential election](/sample-datasets/political-books/); and [people in TrumpWorld](/sample-datasets/trump/).

A sample Gephi project created with the Game of Thrones network data as a teaching tutorial can be viewed and explored [as an interactive web network here](http://melaniewalsh.org/got-network).
